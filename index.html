      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a third shift veterinary assistant at an emergency hospital that is open everyday, 24/7. My job is very challenging on many aspects. My daily task is to keep critical animals comfortable and aid to a longer healthier life. My overall goal everyday is to work to get my patients back to their families. I'm also a fur-mom of an 8 year old pitbull mix, her name is Boop, and a rescue cat named Beetlejuice. I moved to Florida for about 7 years in 2013, and then to Texas for half a year in 2018 before eventually moving back home at the age of 19. Currently, I am 21 and as much as I enjoy saving lives, I'm looking for a change. Web development is a complete turn around from what I do on a daily and I'm more than excited to start my new journey and confident in the support system I have at OSU.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Columbus, Ohio.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are playing my cello, taking my dog to the park, and learning something new. I aslo enjoy doing anything outdoors and love to hammock anywhere I can.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is web development. I'd love the freedom of travel, have creativity in what I do, and also untiy when it comes to working on certain projects with my fellow teammates. I've always wanted to be a veterinarian since I was 5 years old but learned that the career no longer peeked my passion anymore. I was referred by a friend to try out web development which had all the underline credentials that made me interested and push myself to take the opportunity to make that change in my life. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web development is a career where you can be creative, continiously solve issues, and is just a complete change from veterinary medicine. I love a challenge and to broaden my knowledge which is why I was drawn to web development. </p>
